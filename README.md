**A novel interface for rt-fMRI neurofeedback using music**

Here, we present and validate a musical interface for real-time fMRI neurofeedback, applicable in various experimental protocols. The interface is tested using a previously explored motor imagery connectivity-based functional paradigm. To establish both feasibility and utility, we compare the modulation of the bilateral premotor cortex (PMC) during functional runs with real versus sham (random) feedback. Additionally, we compare the musical feedback’s efficacy with a visual feedback interface.
